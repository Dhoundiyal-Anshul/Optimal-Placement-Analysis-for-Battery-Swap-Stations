# **Problem Statement**

The company operates battery swapping and charging stations for e-rickshaws. Their goal is to expand strategically by identifying the best locations for new battery swap stations.


## **Problem**

1. **Underutilized Stations:** Some stations get very little traffic, leading to wasted resources.

2. **Overcrowded Stations:** Other stations face long wait times, frustrating drivers.

3. **Inefficient Expansion:** Without data, they may set up new stations in low-demand areas, leading to losses.

4. **Competitive Pressure:** Other companies may capture high-demand locations first.


### **Goal**

ðŸ”¹ Evaluating geographic and economic factors to determine the feasibility of setting up new stations.\
&#x20;ðŸ”¹ Minimizing inefficiencies by identifying underutilized or overcrowded stations and reallocating resources accordingly.\
&#x20;ðŸ”¹ Balancing costs and benefits by considering infrastructure, land, and electricity costs in decision-making.

**Data Collection & Sources**

**Metro Stations:**

Â ****Used locations (latitude/longitude) for 253 DMRC stations. Excluded stations in high-security zones or airport areas where target vehicles may be restricted.Â 

**Source:** Delhi Open Transit Data (otd.delhi.gov.in)Â 

**Market Areas:**Â 

Used market locations and average daily footfall data.Â 

**Source:** Briefly state source, e.g., Online business directories, Public reportsÂ 

**Population:**Â 

Used zone-wise 2011 Census data as a baseline.Â 

Projected population figures for 2025 based on \[State method simply, e.g., historical growth rates, linear projection].Â 

**Source:** Census of India (2011), with projection as noted**.**

**Methodology**

- Data Sources: Collected data on metro stations, marketplaces, and population density across different zones.

- Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, standardized formats, and ensured geographic coordinates were accurate.

- Relationship Establishment: Connected datasets using MySQL.

**Analysis in Power BI**

- Mapped data points to visualize hotspots for potential swap stations

* High Footfall Areas: Marketplaces with significant daily visitors.

* Metro Connectivity: Nearby metro stations for accessibility.

- Population Density: Zones with high population concentrations.

**Conclusion:**Â 

This data-driven analysis provides clear recommendations for strategic placement of battery swap stations.

Â The Power BI dashboard serves as a valuable tool for ongoing decision-making and exploration.
